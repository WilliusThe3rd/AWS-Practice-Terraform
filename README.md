# AWS-Practice-Terraform
A short AWS and Terraform Project

First I started by installing and verifying Terraform

Then went ahead to download the AWS CLI and configure a few permissions

 After that I ran into a bit of trouble with my AWS Keys due to vscode adding additional characters when pasting, odd that i've never had that issue before but nothing ever goes as planned on the first go round ðŸ¤£. 
 The fix was easy enough, just had to open my credential file in Git-Bash and delete the addtional characters. Another interest point is the extra characters didn't show up in a cat command, only when I opened it directly!
 
 Once that was out of the way my plans came together ðŸ‘Œ
